Dave McClure's AARRR framework provides a high-level overview of important metrics. We then use tactics such as event tracking to instrument those metrics.

The AARRR framework is:

+ Acquisition
+ Activation
+ Retention
+ Revenue
+ Referral

For an early stage product, we work to improve them in this order:

+ Activation: visitor finds the product desirable enough to try, is able to use it and get to aha moment in shortest time possible
+ Retention: user regularly uses product, it is doing the job they hired it for, customer is happy
+ Revenue: user pays for product
+ Acquisition: we know where our users come from, are able to try new channels, run tests, and kill or double-down on different channels
+ Referral: users refer other users, the ideal acquisition channel
