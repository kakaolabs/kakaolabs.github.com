title = "Feature Flags"

Software is soft. It's always changing. Hopefully, we're always learning from our changes.

A cool way to manage changes is via feature flags. Using a tool like Rollout, we can "flag" certain features as only ready for parts of our user base; i.e. just the development team, or just the founder's friends, or 10% of all users, etc.

That way, we can see how users respond to the feature without rolling it out to everyone. We can pair this technique with A/B testing to compare how users respond to different features.
