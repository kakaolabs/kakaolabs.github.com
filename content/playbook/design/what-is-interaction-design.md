+++

Interaction gives users the ability to change the canvas, to directly manipulate. Designing those interactions is what makes our software come to life. Interactions should provide affordance â€” animation, for examples, can be used as a powerful metaphor for helping a user understand an interface. Interactions help guide a user from the beginning of a task through it's completion.

Designers guide these interactions from prototype to implementation. For web applications we start in the browser. For review, we use gifs to demonstrate interactions.
