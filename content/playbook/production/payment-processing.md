For collecting payments from users via credit or debit card, we use Stripe. It is a payment gateway and merchant account. We also use it for recurring billing.

Charges for Stripe will vary depending on usage. Successful credit card charges are 2.9% + 30 cents. There are no setup fees, monthly fees, or card storage fees.

For sending money to users' bank accounts via ACH, we use Plaid.
