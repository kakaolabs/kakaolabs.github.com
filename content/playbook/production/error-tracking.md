We use Honeybadger to track errors in our products.

It supports all of the languages and platforms we use to build applications.

It also provides integrations that make it easy to stay on top of errors. We use its Slack integration for real-time alerts and we use its Trello integration so we can prioritize bugs in the same place as features.
