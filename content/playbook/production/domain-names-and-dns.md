Use Domainr to see what's available.

Use DNSimple to buy and maintain domain names. If you already have a domain registered elsewhere, like GoDaddy, DNSimple provides a transfer service that makes it easy to switch.

We like it for its simplicity. It also has templates we most often need:

+ Heroku
+ Google Apps
+ Cloudflare
+ Fastly
+ GitHub Pages
+ Netlify

Follow the Custom Domains tutorial to set up root and subdomains on Heroku.
