## Principle Zero
We regularly eliminate and simplify policies. Our most important policy is "use your best judgement". We call this Principle Zero.

## Fulfillment
We maintain an inclusive environment where we can thrive professionally and personally. We maintain a sustainable pace of productivity, and full lives outside of work. We maximize our ability to take on any project by creating a diverse team who can bring their experience and perspectives together to solve problems. We are proud of the work we are doing, and believe that it is meaningful, worth existing, and improves society and human well-being.

## Continuous Improvement
We recognize that we can always be better. Therefore, we have strong opinions, loosely held, and take initiative to improve ourselves, the company, and our community.

This is a never-ending task, because there is always room for improvement. This week should be better than last, and we should be optimistic that next week will be better than this week. We learn new things, and share those things with our peers and community.

## Transparency
We avoid having private conversations about each other or clients. Instead, we talk in person, and use tools such as Slack, Basecamp, and GitHub to communicate openly within a project, within thoughtbot, and publicly.

## Honesty
While we are cognizant of people's feelings, and seek to work with each other constructively, we cannot let those concerns get in the way of our happiness and the success of our work. We'd rather be too honest than too polite.

## Trust
Our standards are very high, and bringing on a new team member requires a "yes" from everyone who participated in the interview process. Therefore, we expect the best from each other, give each other the benefit of the doubt, encourage each other to take initiative to improve ourselves and the company, and provide direct and constructive help to each other.

We do all of this while maintaining the privacy and confidentiality that every person deserves.

## Collaboration
We want to choose our own tools and bring a respected voice to the way our projects are run. We are not in the room to take orders, we're in the room to collaborate and solve problems. We insist on working for clients who value our role and experience.

## Long-term Thinking
We prefer long-term viability over near-term shortcuts. It is more important that the organization exist in five years than it is that we make an extra dollar this year. We are running a marathon and not a sprint.

## Minimize Hierarchy
We strive for few job titles, few departments, and few hierarchies. We prefer composition of roles necessary for projects and company objectives over inheritance of bosses and direct reports. We are at thoughtbot primarily for our design and development skill, and want to apply it, rather than creating company overhead.

## Quality
We create working, maintainable, and understandable software that is enjoyable and easy to use. We improve the quality of the process and the client's environment. Beyond that, designing and building quality software means improving the security, privacy, and accessibility of the product, and includes improvements of life and reduction of harm for all users and contributors.
