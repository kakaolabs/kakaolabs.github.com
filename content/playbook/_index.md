## This is our playbook

We are Kakaolabs. We have worked with hundreds of product teams all over the world, from individual founders who are self-funded, to large multi-national organizations. We have also created our own products and dozens of open source libraries.

This is our playbook. It details how we make successful web and mobile products, and also how we run our company. It's filled with things we've learned based on our own experience and study of others' experiences.

## Designing

Our projects are frequently undergoing rapid change. Designers need to use tools and processes appropriate for that environment.

+ [Sketching the Interface](/playbook/design/sketching-the-interface)
+ [Test Product Viability and Usability](/playbook/design/test-product)
+ [What is Interaction Design?](/playbook/design/what-is-interaction-design)
+ [What is User Interface Design?](/playbook/design/what-is-user-interface-design)

## Laptop Setup

Your laptop is your sword. Don't go into battle without it.

+ [Automate your development environment](/playbook/laptop/automate-your-development-environment)
+ [Share configuration with dotfiles](/playbook/laptop/share-configuration-with-dotfiles)
+ [Use an extensible editor](/playbook/laptop/use-an-extensible-editor)

## Developing

The majority of our development practices were first detailed in Kent Beck's classic Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change and in Gerald Weinberg's The Psychology of Computer Programming. We've tried its practices and found that using most of the practices most of the time improves the quality of our work and happiness of our team.

## Production
We live in a magical modern era where many problems have already been solved for us. We focus on the core product as much as possible and outsource operations as much as possible to external services.

+ [SSL Certificates](/playbook/production/ssl-certificates)
+ [Transactional Email](/playbook/production/transactional-email)

## Measuring

The difficult part of measuring is deciding what to track. Dave McClure's AARRR framework provides a high-level overview of important metrics. We then use tactics such as event tracking to instrument those metrics.
