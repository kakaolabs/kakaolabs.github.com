Test-Driven Development (TDD) is perhaps the most important Extreme Programming (XP) rule that we practice.

Business benefits of TDD:

+ Deliver more value, faster
+ Always ship working software
+ Adapt to change quickly

Code benefits of TDD:

+ Readable specs and code
+ Clean public interfaces
+ Decoupled modules

Process benefits of TDD:

+ Regression safety net
+ Fearless refactoring
+ Team trust

At a high level, how to test is very simple:

+ Write test first.
+ Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

For more specifics, we recommend our Test-Driven Rails workshop. It goes into incredible detail about the TDD workflow specifically for Ruby on Rails developers.
