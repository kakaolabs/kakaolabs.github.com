title = "Style Guide"
+++
We write code in a consistent style that emphasizes cleanliness and team communication.

High level guidelines:

+ Be consistent.
+ Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.
+ Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
+ A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.

Where we can, we set up Hound to help automate following the style guide during Code Review, which helps us stick to our high-level guidelines and keep our reviews focused on code legibility & quality.
