title = "Share configuration with dotfiles"
+++

'Dotfile' is a generalized term for a UNIX configuration file, typically prefixed with a dot (e.g. .vimrc) and found in your home directory. Most UNIX programs, including Vim, will load a dotfile during launch.

We recommend using dotfiles to customize your tools and environment to suit your preferences, reduce typing, and get work done. Check them into a git repository for safe-keeping and open-source for the benefit of others.

You can use our dotfiles to make pair programming with teammates easier and make each other more productive.
